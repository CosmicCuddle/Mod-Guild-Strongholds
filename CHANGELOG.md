- Created documented hybrid Guild Strongholds design.
- Added ten racial architectural themes and guild-wide/personal-IP rules.
- Added roadmap, rollback and uninstall policies.

## 0.2.0-settlement-catalog (design/prototype; unreleased)

- Registered ten faction-appropriate racial architectural themes in a pure C++ catalogue.
- Added six logical construction plots each for the initial Human and Orc prototypes.
- Added no-client-input faction selection and fail-closed guild entry policy helpers; these do **not** yet enforce live server isolation.
